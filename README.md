# documenting-things
Repo for talk at posit::conf(2023)

## Brainstorm

Slide one: I'm going to make my case and give tips in 5 minutes from what I have observed and repeat in my own work. Style of Jenny Bryan enabled by tooling like RMarkdown/Quarto + GitHub.Then build out these ideas more with examples from real researchers that we've worked with in gov and academia
Slide 2: Walter White meme. "have you ever had this feeling onboardong to a project. Even if it is just you?"

Question to answer: how do you make documenting things maintainable and (dare-I-say) joyful?
What if writing documentation was awesome? (Documenting things doesn't have to be painful)
Documentation - what am I talking about? Audience. Purpose. Divio. 

### Possible high-level

1. voice - write to be useful to you, engaging. What do you want to remember
1. modularize - like we do with code
    1. design your docs in a way that can be moved around/refactored (not in a linear way) (importance for maintenance over time)
    2. this will evolve, like ggplot2, like cookbook <> champions <> approach-guide
1. formatting - readability, accessibility
    1. markdown for `code`, [hyperlink the thing](); more helpful than hyperlinking [here]()
    2. alt text - shows when the image doesn't show up. Searchable.
    3. headers for navigation - naming things

Stories: 
- Effect
  - FayLab co-creation, onboarding, maintenance; growth & maintain
  - I Fenwick, E Holmes leadership: (pathways: document event series; nmfs-opensci resource book) level up in job

Structure: 
- 1 min intro
- 5 min lightening talk (context, flyby, hook)
- 9-10 min stories: effect and impact
- 2 min closing

Resources to Share: 

- Divio
- Carpentries lessons/instructor training

## Abstract

### Documenting things: openly for future us

RMarkdown and Quarto are shifting the paradigm for how professionals learn to code, write documentation, and teach others. I'll showcase the style I first experienced by Jenny Bryan (Stat545, Happy Git With R, What They Forgot): narrative and code together, shared openly as a website, that builds trust with learners and provides a resource to consult during and outside of live-teaching. This mode shifts culture in a powerful way, since we can fork this idea, repeat it in our own work. I’ll share examples of how professional researchers are using this style to write open documentation, from technical workflows to community onboarding. I’ll also highlight design elements for writing open documentation, and tips for doing so with Quarto.
