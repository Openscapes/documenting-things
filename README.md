Slide one: I'm going to make my case and give tips in 5 minutes from what I have observed and repeat in my own work. Style of Jenny Bryan enabled by tooling like RMarkdown/Quarto + GitHub.Then build out these ideas more with examples from real researchers that we've worked with in gov and academia
Slide 2: Walter White meme. "have you ever had this feeling onboardong to a project. Even if it is just you?"

1. voice - write to be useful to you, engaging. What do you want to remember
