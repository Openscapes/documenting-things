# documenting-things
Repo for talk at posit::conf(2023)

## Brainstorm

Slide one: I'm going to make my case and give tips in 5 minutes from what I have observed and repeat in my own work. Style of Jenny Bryan enabled by tooling like RMarkdown/Quarto + GitHub.Then build out these ideas more with examples from real researchers that we've worked with in gov and academia
Slide 2: Walter White meme. "have you ever had this feeling onboardong to a project. Even if it is just you?"

Question to answer: how do you make documenting things maintainable and (dare-I-say) joyful?
What if writing documentation was awesome? (Documenting things doesn't have to be painful)
Documentation - what am I talking about? Audience. Purpose. Divio. 

# Outline 

## 2-min intro & signposting
- Hi, I'm Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science community. Director of Openscapes. 
- Talking today about Documenting Things Openly for Future Us.
  - Things - could be code, teaching resources, how to organize files in your group
  - Future Us - mindset beyond you and your computer
  - 5-min lightening talk then stories
  - annotated resources at end; Jenny Bryan ðŸ’™

## 5-min Documenting things doesn't have to be painful
- **engaging voice** for your audience
- **modular design** so can be reused/refactored
- **formatted for readability**, accessibility, and navigation

## 8-min This is what it looks like

- NASA teams - Earthdata Cloud Cookbook
- Fisheries ecology teams 

## 2-min This is what's possible

- maintainance isn't terrible; onboarding new folks
- level up in job

***

## High-level Brainstorm 
1. voice - write to be useful to you, engaging. What do you want to remember
1. modularize - like we do with code
    1. design your docs in a way that can be moved around/refactored (not in a linear way) (importance for maintenance over time)
    2. this will evolve, like ggplot2, like cookbook <> champions <> approach-guide
1. formatting - readability, accessibility
    1. markdown for `code`, [hyperlink the thing](); more helpful than hyperlinking [here]()
    2. alt text - shows when the image doesn't show up. Searchable.
    3. headers for navigation - naming things

Stories: 
- Effect
  - FayLab co-creation, onboarding, maintenance; growth & maintain
  - I Fenwick, E Holmes leadership: (pathways: document event series; nmfs-opensci resource book) level up in job

Structure: 
- 1 min intro
- 5 min lightening talk (context, flyby, hook)
- 9-10 min stories: effect and impact
- 2 min closing

## Abstract
https://posit.co/blog/keynotes-and-talks-at-posit-conf-2023/

### Documenting things: openly for future us

RMarkdown and Quarto are shifting the paradigm for how professionals learn to code, write documentation, and teach others. I'll showcase the style I first experienced by Jenny Bryan (Stat545, Happy Git With R, What They Forgot): narrative and code together, shared openly as a website, that builds trust with learners and provides a resource to consult during and outside of live-teaching. This mode shifts culture in a powerful way, since we can fork this idea, repeat it in our own work. Iâ€™ll share examples of how professional researchers are using this style to write open documentation, from technical workflows to community onboarding. Iâ€™ll also highlight design elements for writing open documentation, and tips for doing so with Quarto.
