Notes: 

- Documenting things is changing the way we build movements and change culture within and across organizations â€” I'll share how its changing how researchers tackle climate change. 
- It can help people feel less lost and like they belong.
- Doesn't have to be painful to write and boring to read.

## Who am I?
- Let me back up, I'm Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science communities over past 10 years. Shifted my career - Director of Openscapes. 

## Definitions & Plan
  - Things - could be code, teaching resources, how to organize files in your group
  - Future Us - mindset beyond you and your computer
  - Plan today: 5-min lightening talk then stories
  - Annotated resources at end; Jenny Bryan ðŸ’™

## How to document things openly for future us:

- **Engaging voice for your audience**
- **Modular design so can be reused**
- **Formatted for readability, accessibility, and sharing**

## Engaging voice for your audience
You have an audience. 

  - First audience: Future You. What do you want to remember?
  - Second audience: Future Us. 
  - We not you
  - Not dry

You're writing this for someone. Picture talking to them.

## Modular design so can be reused

  - design your docs in a way that can be moved around (not in a linear way) (importance for maintenance over time)
  - write it down, can be moved later. Helps with incremental writing and not having it loom.
  - this will evolve, like ggplot2. scripts call other packages. Think like that.


## formatted for readability, accessibility, and sharing
  - quarto, rmarkdown, google docs
  - as open as possible - shared online (breadcrumbs)


Transition: hopefully now you're interested in hearing some stories of what this looks like and what's possible from it

## This is what it looks like & what's possible 

Next:

2 stories: NASA and NOAA Fisheries ecology teams

Movement building though shared documentation

## NASA Cloud Cookbook scope

- NASA Earthdata teams - purpose understanding Earth and climate change
- Image: early framing: carpentries lessons <> Cookbook <> proj pythia.


## NASA Cloud Cookbook Contributing

- fits with  Contributing section early. 
  - maintainance isn't terrible; onboarding new folks
  - increasing contributors
  
## NASA Cloud Cookbook policy
  
  - Moving to nasa.gov

## NOAA Fisheries scope
- Fisheries ecology teams - purpose (manage seafood)
- Champions Cohorts â€” documentation really key
- image: FayLab, FIMS 
  
## NOAA Fisheries movement building

- pathways: document event series; nmfs-opensci resource book, 

## NOAA Fisheries Open data policy
  - NOAA Fisheries open data policy
  - level up in job

## How to document things openly for future us:

- **Engaging voice for your audience**
- **Modular design so can be reused/refactored**
- **Formatted for readability, accessibility, and sharing**

(revisit hook)

- With these 3 things I gave you with the lightening talk, this is possible
  - Doesnâ€™t have to be painful, doesnâ€™t have to be hard, can accomplish great things.
