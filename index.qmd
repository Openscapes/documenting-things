## Documenting things: openly for future us

### Julia Stewart Lowndes

### posit::conf(2023)


::: notes
Documenting things can change culture 
- Documenting things is changing the way we build movements and change culture within and across organizations â€” I'll share how its changing how researchers tackle climate change. 
- It can help people feel less lost and like they belong.
- Doesn't have to be painful to write and boring to read.
- My name is Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science communities over past 10 years. Shifted my career - Director of Openscapes.

## Things | Future Us
  - Things - could be code, teaching resources, how to organize files in your group
  - Future Us - mindset beyond you and your computer

### Format for readability, accessibility, and navigation

  - Plan today: 5-min lightening talk then stories
  - Annotated resources at end; Jenny Bryan ðŸ’™

## [Have a place]

TODO: images: wiki, google doc, quarto book. 

It doesn't matter where at first, get it started. 

## Write as you go

Paste from your email/slack and put it here instead

Modular. 

Not looming all at once.

## Think reuse **most abstract**

Write in short bits. Think of these like functions that can call each other. Will be networked, not linear.

TODO visual: function calls

Instead of writing things twice, know where the information is so you can link. Write it in this holding call. 

Maybe: advice on GH usernames

:::notes
  - design your docs in a way that can be moved around (not in a linear way) (importance for maintenance over time)
  - write it down, can be moved later. Helps with incremental writing and not having it loom.
  - this will evolve, like ggplot2. scripts call other packages. Think like that.
  - have a place. Something that would go in an email or slack â€” put it there instead.

## [Have an audience]

You're writing this for someone. Picture talking to them. Not dry. Specific.

TODO Images: screenshots/text of Jenny Bryan's WTF, Stat545, Happy Git with R

Future You

## Future Us

**We're in this together**

When we write tutorials, we write them as if we're teaching them outloud. What you would say is included. And we design the code in chunks for learners.

TODO Images: R for Excel Users

"We" not "you"

Inclusive

## Share it

- "as open as possible, as closed as necessary" 

- shared online (**breadcrumbs**)
- network it to other things, don't maintain content in 2 places.
- can help you refine place quarto, rmarkdown, google docs

## [Format for readability, accessibility, and navigation]
  
## Headers and Slugs

Naming things - could list Jenny's 3 points


## Alt text

## Use markdown 

`code`

Transition: hopefully now you're interested in hearing some stories of what this looks like and what's possible from it

Next:

2 stories: NASA and NOAA Fisheries ecology teams

Movement building though shared documentation

:::


## NASA Cloud Cookbook scope 

## TO THINK ABOUT: how does this tie back to the 3 lightning talks. Don't belabor
"When they were thinking about the Cookbook, they were really thinking about X"

- NASA Earthdata teams - purpose understanding Earth and climate change
- Image: early framing: carpentries lessons <> Cookbook <> proj pythia.


## NASA Cloud Cookbook Contributing

- fits with  Contributing section early. 
  - maintainance isn't terrible; onboarding new folks
  - increasing contributors
  
## NASA Cloud Cookbook policy
  
  - Moving to nasa.gov

## NOAA Fisheries scope
- Fisheries ecology teams - purpose (manage seafood)
- Champions Cohorts â€” documentation really key
- image: FayLab, FIMS 
  
## NOAA Fisheries movement building

- pathways: document event series; nmfs-opensci resource book, 

## NOAA Fisheries Open data policy
  - NOAA Fisheries open data policy
  - level up in job

## How to document things openly for future us:

### Have a place
### Have an audience 
### Format for readability, accessibility, and navigation

(revisit hook)

- With these 3 things I gave you with the lightening talk, this is possible
  - Doesnâ€™t have to be painful, doesnâ€™t have to be hard, can accomplish great things.
