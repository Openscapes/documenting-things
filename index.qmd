## Documenting things can help change culture 
what I'm going to share here is changing the way NASA teaches researchers working on climate change. 

Movement building.

Doesn't have to be painful to write and read.

(Hook, maybe say this on title slide.)

## Who am I?
- Let me back up, I'm Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science communities over past 10 years. Shifted my career - Director of Openscapes. 

## Definitions & Plan
  - Things - could be code, teaching resources, how to organize files in your group
  - Future Us - mindset beyond you and your computer
  - Plan today: 5-min lightening talk then stories
  - Annotated resources at end; Jenny Bryan ðŸ’™

## How to document things openly for future us:

- **Engaging voice for your audience**
- **Modular design so can be reused/refactored**
- **Formatted for readability, accessibility, and sharing**

## Engaging voice for your audience
You have an audience. 

  - First audience: Future You. What do you want to remember?
  - Second audience: Future Us. 
  - We not you
  - Not dry

You're writing this for someone. Picture talking to them.

## Modular design so can be reused/refactored

  - design your docs in a way that can be moved around/refactored (not in a linear way) (importance for maintenance over time)
  - write it down, can be moved later. Helps with incremental writing and not having it loom.
  - this will evolve, like ggplot2


## formatted for readability, sharing, accessibility, and navigation
  - quarto, rmarkdown, google docs
  - as open as possible - shared online (breadcrumbs)


Transition: hopefully now you're interested in hearing some stories of what this looks like and what's possible from it

## This is what it looks like & what's possible 

Next:

2 stories: NASA and NOAA Fisheries ecology teams

Movement building though shared documentation

## NASA Cloud Cookbook scope

- NASA Earthdata teams - purpose
- Image: early framing: carpentries lessons <> Cookbook <> proj pythia.


## NASA Cloud Cookbook Contributing

- fits with  Contributing section early. 
  - maintainance isn't terrible; onboarding new folks
  - increasing contributors
  
## NASA Cloud Cookbook policy
  
  - Moving to nasa.gov

## NOAA Fisheries scope
- Fisheries ecology teams - purpose (manage seafood)
- Champions Cohorts â€” documentation really key
- image: FayLab, FIMS 
  
## NOAA Fisheries movement building

- pathways: document event series; nmfs-opensci resource book, 

## NOAA Fisheries Open data policy
  - NOAA Fisheries open data policy
  - level up in job

## How to document things openly for future us:

- **Engaging voice for your audience**
- **Modular design so can be reused/refactored**
- **Formatted for readability, accessibility, and sharing**

(revisit hook)

- With these 3 things I gave you with the lightening talk, this is possible
  - Doesnâ€™t have to be painful, doesnâ€™t have to be hard, can accomplish great things.
