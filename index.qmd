# SPEAKER NOTES
# - Hi! I'm here to share about documenting things and how intentional approaches is helpling teams tackle hard challeges and change organizational culture. 
#- My name is Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science communities over past the 10 years. Documenting things has been a big part of shifting my career I now lead  a program called Openscapes. 
# - So let's talk about Documenting things: Openly for future us

THINGS 
:::

**all the things**

-   code & analyses
-   teaching resources
-   onboarding & community
-   fieldwork/lab protocols
-   blogs
-   events

FUTURE US
:::

**mindset & habit**
 
-   ourselves, teams, communities

-   in the next hour, week, decades

-   intentional, inclusive
:::
:::

::: notes
when I say things when I say future us, I'm thinking of a mindset beyond you and your computer. So thinking about how what you document now can save hundreds of emails later asking where things are or how to do things.

- my opinionated take on documenting things‚Äù

-   I'm also here to say documenting things doesn't have to be painful to write and boring to read.
-   I have 3 pieces of advice:
-   the plan for today
:::

## Have a place {.yellow-bg}

It doesn't matter where at first. Just write it down.

::: notes
This can be whatever software you have transition: what's important about having a place is that it helps you write as you go -
:::

## Write as you go {.yellow-bg}

Develop the habit of writing things down in this place; break down otherwise looming tasks.

## Write in a modular way {.yellow-bg}

Writing in small bits is less daunting to write & maintain collaboratively.

Modular bits can be networked; not limited to linear flow.

:::

::: notes
Instead of writing things twice, know where the information is so you can link to it (Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

These are two examples from R for Excel Users, on the left

-   If you write code, you can think of this like calling functions from from other scripts or packages. Think like that.
-   Think of it like we have functions we call from another script. It lives one place
:::

## Make space {.yellow-bg}
Claim time to write - this won't document itself! One pasted email at a time.

Tell people you're documenting things: increase visibility, value, contributors.

<br>

![](images/AmySteiker-EarthdataClinic-DryRun2023-05-17.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of three people in Zoom that are screensharing writing documentation and in collaborating in jupyterhub" fig-align="center" width="40%"}

::: notes
Making it visible helps give it value. And find contributors.

Bigger lifts: put it on the calendar. Cowork with a colleague.

:::

## Have an audience {.yellow-bg}

You're writing this for someone. Often, many audiences. 

Make it engaging - doesn't have to be dry or distant.

## Write in an inclusive tone {.yellow-bg}

We're in this together: Your readers are intelligent people, who are here to learn from you.

Consider your goals and style that welcome readers; e.g. avoid words that trivialize like 'simply'.

<br>



::: notes


Write as if these different audiences are all in the room with you. directed toward different audiences


:::

## Narrate code in small chunks {.yellow-bg}

Write short narrations for your code as you'd say it out loud.
Match this with your purpose; it's especially important for teaching.

Quarto now has a cool [code annotation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/code-annotation.html) feature to help!

::: notes
When we write tutorials with code, we write them as if we're teaching them outloud. What you would say is included. And we design the code in chunks for learners.
:::

## Share it {.yellow-bg}
Share online so people can find it - readers, contributors, users. 

Consider permissions & leverage different technologies to leave breadcrumbs.

'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'

## Design for readability, accessibility, & navigation {.yellow-bg}

TODO: screenshot. Alison Hill? Desiree?

::: notes
-   aesthetics matter, and don't have to be super time-consuming
-   accessibility matters - can mean screenreaders, low bandwidth, paywalls/permissions, and much more
-   navigation mtters - helping Future Us find what we need
:::

## Use section headers {.yellow-bg}

Section headers are important for screen readers to describe sections and flow.

You can anchor directly to them to share an anchored URL.

<br>

[Naming things](https://github.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files#how-to-name-files) üíô is key here - "embrace the slug"



::: notes
Helps with accessibility since screen readers treat headers a specific way.
 
These are examples from Google Doc where you can insert a bookmark and Quarto where you can anchor in Markdown.

Maybe: Be Consistent - Not "example" and then 2nd example has a diff name. Indenting.
:::


## Use text formatting {.yellow-bg}

Formatting helps your readers follow along. 

::: borderbox
![](images/format-fonts-links.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a blog post where the hyperlinked text says Fire and Tree Mortality Database and the words tidymodels and geomtextpath are formatted for code" fig-align="center" width="80%"}
:::

::: ref-text
Horst, [Exploring tree outcomes following fires](https://allisonhorst.github.io/posts/2022-03-10-tree-mortality-fires/).
:::

<br>

Distinguish `code` with fonts; (in Markdown use backticks: \`code\` )

Hyperlink text like [Fire and Tree Mortality Database](https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2020-0001), not that this important thing is [here](https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2020-0001).


## Alternative text ("alt text") {.yellow-bg}

::: notes
note alt text should not just repeat the caption (if you have one) it should be descriptive - paint the picture of whatever you‚Äôre talking about so someone with a screen reader can listen to the alt text and get the same details and take home messages as someone who can look at the image
