# SPEAKER NOTES
# - Hi! I'm going to talk about how documenting things can build visibility for yourself and change culture across organizations, with examples from NASA and NOAA communities tackling climate change. 
#- My name is Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science communities over past the 10 years. Documenting things has been a big part of shifting my career - Director of Openscapes.

THINGS
:::

**all the things** 

- code
- teaching resources
- onboarding
- fieldwork/lab protocols
- events
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

FUTURE US
:::

**mindset & habit** 

- ourselves, teams, communities 

- in the next hour, week, decades

- intentional, inclusive

:::

:::notes
when I say things
when I say future us, I'm thinking of a mindset beyond you and your computer. So thinking about how what you document now can save hundreds of emails later asking where things are or how to do things.

## [Documenting things doesn't have to be painful:]{.yellow-bg}

<br>

::: {.yellow-bg}
::: {.doc-things-text}
Have a place

Have an audience 

Format for readability, accessibility, and navigation
:::
:::

<br>

Plan today:

  - 5-min lightening talk (inspired by [Jenny Bryan's Naming Files](https://github.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files#how-to-name-files)) ðŸ’™
  - 10-mins of stories (and opinions)
  
:::notes
- I'm also here to say documenting things doesn't have to be painful to write and boring to read.
- I have 3 pieces of advice: 
- the plan for today 
:::

## [Have a place]{.yellow-bg}

TODO: images: wiki, google doc, quarto book. 

It doesn't matter where at first, get it started. Write it down.

:::notes
This can be whatever software you have
transition: what's important about having a place is that it helps you write as you go - 
:::

## Write as you go

Develop the habit of writing things down in this place. 

Paste from your email/slack and put it here instead

Write in small bites - not looming all at once.

Write directly. Google Doc comments/issues have tendency to prolong/make ardous; write that thought in the doc. 

:::notes
you might find yourself writing it in an issue. depending, write it down in the doc itself. Like editing directly rather than adding a comment in a Google doc
:::

## Write in a modular way (short bits)

Design your docs in a way that can be moved around and networked

- Instead of writing things twice, know where the information is so you can link to it (Don't repeat yourself (DRY) (cite))

- Important for maintenance over time





:::notes

  - write it down, can be moved later. Helps with incremental writing and not having it loom.
  - this will evolve, like ggplot2. scripts call other packages. Think like that.
  - Think of it like we have functions we call from another script. It lives one place
:::

## [Have an audience]{.yellow-bg}

You're writing this for someone. Picture talking to them. Not dry. Specific.

POP as a tool

<br>

TODO Images: screenshots/text of Jenny Bryan's WTF, Stat545, Happy Git with R

Future You

## Write in an inclusive tone

Mindset: We're in this together (Future Us)

Write what you'd actually say / keep things relevant to that audience

When we write tutorials, we write them as if we're teaching them outloud. What you would say is included. And we design the code in chunks for learners.

TODO Images: R for Excel Users

:::notes
"We" not "you"

Inclusive
:::

## Share it

- "as open as possible, as closed as necessary" 
- shared online (**breadcrumbs**)

- can help you refine place quarto, rmarkdown, google docs

- consider contributors

IMAGE: github link to google docs. Not accessible to everyone. ok.

## [Format for readability, accessibility, and navigation]{.yellow-bg}

- aesthetics matter, and don't have to be super time-consuming
- accessibility matters - can mean screenreaders, low bandwidth, paywalls/permissions, and much more
- navigation mtters - helping Future Us find what we need
  
## Headers and Slugs

Use section headers - you can link directly to them

- TODO IMAGE: Google Doc Bookmark, Quarto anchor

Name things with this in mind

- Naming things - list Jenny's 3 points & video links

Be Consistent -  Not "example" and then 2nd example has a diff name. Indenting.


## Alt text



## Fonts and linking

TODO: Write out how to do these things: 

`code`

[link to the important part]() not just the word [here]()

<br>

...Transition: And whether or not you use Markdown - 

## Keyboard shortcuts

Arrow keys + shift + option

- TODO: GIF of this and embed :grimacing: 

Shift-command 8 for bullets

: more and more for emojis

:::notes
you can use keyboard shortcuts

## Movement building

<br>

![](images/openscapes-flywheel-simple.png){fig-alt="A diagram of the Openscapes flywheel. The Openscapes logo sits in the center of a cyclical process. The text around the logo reads as follows: 'Welcome bright spots (be they mentors or researchers) -- people who want to work better and collaborate' > 'Create space and place to connect and collaborate; remove barriers to participation (paid time, part of jobs)' > 'Invest in learning and trust; Everyone has something to learn, ask, teach; don't need to be an expert in everything. Cultivate psychological safety, growth mindset. Slowing down to speed up.' > 'Work Openly; Put what you learn into practice quickly, role-modeing sharing imperfect work and identifying common challenges and opportunities. Openness is a spectrum; first Future You and then Future Us' > Leverage common workflows, skills, tools; This is where we speed up: Iterate, reuse, remix with each other and teh broader community' > 'Inspire broader scientific communities through visible examples and leaders -- Open science shift' > repeat. These six steps are summarized by three overarching goals, which are also written around the logo: 'Engage a future us mindset', 'Empower learning culture', and 'Amplify open leaders'." fig-align="center" width="100%"}

TODO: TO THINK ABOUT: how does this tie back to the 3 lightning talk points. Don't belabor

## Project website

[nasa-openscapes.github.io/mentors](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/mentors)

- A place we created to give visibility to the project

- Invite participation the first mentors

- Comms strategy: Important info here, not only in a forwarded email

- Updatable with new info, refine based on questions


:::notes

"When they were thinking about the Cookbook, they were really thinking about X"
:::

## Cloud Cookbook 

[nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/contributing/onboarding](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/contributing/onboarding)

- A place we created to co-develop teaching resources for researchers

- Contributing section was early addition; how to access our cloud infrastructure

- Information for learning quarto, GitHub branches and pull requests

- Also: how to welcome mentors

TODO: screenshot

:::notes
- fits with  Contributing section early. 
  - maintainance isn't terrible; onboarding new folks
  - increasing contributors
:::


## Approach Guide

[openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/mentors-framework/onboarding](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/mentors-framework/onboarding)

- A place for us to write down repeated tasks, onboard each other to how we work

- Focused on this in Year 3; the other two were first priority. Iterative. this is the right time, and our other documentation made it easier to repeat (breadcrumbs) and then write this as we have time. 


TODO: screenshot

## Paying it forward - serves us all well 

- NASA Mentor Community sustainability & handoff
  - mentor cohort > community
- NOAA Fisheries Mentor Community - repeating the flywheel
  - early visibility with website. grant co-PI Eli Holmes!
  - nmfs-opensci resource book
- Openscapes Mentor Community 
  - California Water Boards
  - Pathways to Open Science - document event series
  - Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center

## Learning and inspiration is cyclical

Learn from, with, for each other

Reuse, learn from, link to. Share stories and methods.

TODO 4 images (like this <https://mine.quarto.pub/hello-quarto/#/nasa-quarto-sites>)

- Faylab Manual
- NMFS Kourtney Burger, FIMS
- Jenny Bryan
- Better science in less time? Fig 1 image

## Closing opinions

- Helps gain visibility and value: Making the invisible visible
- Get comfortable with imperfect
- It takes time. part of your job. Paid time. Aligns with your job
- It can help people feel less lost and like they belong.
- Role model reuse of documentation (like we reuse code/packages)
- (Maybe: emojis aren't trite. Relieves misunderstandings, helps you say "I got it", "I've seen it")
- Take these practices to new places - meeting agendas, physical notebooks TODO Maybe: screenshot of my notebook

:::notes
I have a notebook - daily writing is smaller and ideas are bigger. I have a place, it helps my mind unleash

(revisit hook)

- With these 3 things I gave you with the lightening talk, this is possible
  - Doesnâ€™t have to be painful, doesnâ€™t have to be hard, can accomplish great things.
