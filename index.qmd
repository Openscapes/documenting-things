::: notes
Hi! I'm here to share about documenting things and how intentional approaches is helpling teams tackle hard challeges and change organizational culture. 

My name is Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science communities over past the 10 years. Documenting things has been a big part of shifting my career I now lead  a program called Openscapes. 

So let's talk about Documenting things: Openly for future us

FUTURE US

**mindset & habit**
 
-   ourselves, teams, communities

-   in the next hour, week, decades

-   intentional, inclusive
:::
:::
:::

::: notes
when I say things, I mean all the things. When I say future us, I'm thinking of a mindset beyond you and your computer. So thinking about how what you document now can save hundreds of emails later asking where things are or how to do things.

it's supposed to be helpful

It does take time, and intentionality. 

We're going to talk about practiacl tips in a lighttning talk and then in stories we'll give more about creating that time and visbility for this valuable work. And the TL;DR is in this  editorial about 
<!-- place: tech: google docs, README, Zoom, office, Quarto, GitHub, slot in your calendar -->
<!-- space: people: time, approval from your supervisor, physical , intentional, part of your job, advocating. coworking is the practice of creating space -->
<!-- The hard part about documentation is being intentional, having this be part of your job. Making space is the hard part -->

:::

## {{< fa angle-right >}} Have a place {background="#FFF6E1"}

It doesn't matter where at first. Just write it down.

This can be whatever software you have transition: what's important about having a place is that it helps you write as you go -
:::

## *Write as you go* {background="#FFF6E1"}

Develop the habit of writing things down in this place; copy/paste from email.

Break down documentation as an otherwise big and looming task.

Writing in small bits is less daunting to write & maintain collaboratively.

::: notes
Instead of writing things twice, know where the information is so you can link to it (Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
:::

## {{< fa angle-right >}} Have an audience in mind {background="#FFF6E1"}

You're writing this for someone. Often, many audiences with different entryways. 

Make it engaging, specific. Doesn't have to be dry or distant.

## *Write in an inclusive tone* {background="#FFF6E1"}

We're in this together: Your readers are intelligent & here to learn from you.

Consider your goals and style that welcome readers; e.g. avoid words that trivialize

> Avoid: "simply clone the repo"

<br>



::: notes

"simply clone the repo"

Write as if these different audiences are all in the room with you. directed toward different audiences


:::

## *Narrate code in small chunks* {background="#FFF6E1"}

Write short narrations for your code as you'd say it out loud.
Match this with your purpose; it's especially important for teaching.

Quarto now has a new [code annotation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/code-annotation.html) feature to help!

:::

<br>


::: notes
When we write tutorials with code, we write them as if we're teaching them outloud. What you would say is included. And we design the code in chunks for learners.


:::

## *Share early* {background="#FFF6E1"}
Share early to iterate and receive feedback. Open does not always mean public. 

Consider permissions & leverage different technologies to leave breadcrumbs.

<br>

::: borderbox
![](images/nmfs-opensci-508-breadcrumb.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of NOAA Fisheries Open Science Resource Book on the page with 508 Compliance. A red arrow points to blue text that says Recording of R UG Meeting and in red text says Internal link" fig-align="center" width="65%"}

Breadcrumbs. Internal link for NOAA Fisheries. That's ok. We can still all learn a lot by having as much public.

## {{< fa angle-right >}} Design for readability & accessibility {background="#FFF6E1"}

## *Use section headers* {background="#FFF6E1"}

Section headers are important for screen readers to describe sections and flow.

You can anchor directly to them to share an anchored URL.

[Naming things](https://github.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files#how-to-name-files) üíô is key here - "embrace the slug"

:::

:::
:::

::: notes
Helps with accessibility since screen readers treat headers a specific way.
 
These are examples from Google Doc where you can insert a bookmark and Quarto where you can anchor in Markdown.

Maybe: Be Consistent - Not "example" and then 2nd example has a diff name. Indenting.
:::

## *Use text formatting* {background="#FFF6E1"}

Formatting helps your readers follow along. 

<br>

Hyperlink the important text, not that this important thing is [here](https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2020-0001).

Distinguish `code` with fonts; (in Markdown use backticks: \`code\` )

::: borderbox

:::



## *Alternative text ("alt text")* {background="#FFF6E1"}
Use alt text to describe the details and takehome messages in your visuals.

![](images/horst-hill-knitting-hedgehogs.png){fig-alt="A round hedgehog knitting a yellow sock. A rabbit with a teal beanie and wearing one yellow sock watches in anticipation. A shelf to the left of them contains yarn in a tote labeled TEXT, and knitting patterns in a tote labeled CODE." fig-align="center" width="80%"}

**Alt text**:  A round hedgehog knitting a yellow sock. A rabbit with a teal beanie and wearing one yellow sock watches in anticipation. A shelf to the left of them contains yarn in a tote labeled TEXT, and knitting patterns in a tote labeled CODE.

::: notes
note alt text should not just repeat the caption (if you have one) it should be descriptive - paint the picture of whatever you‚Äôre talking about so someone with a screen reader can listen to the alt text and get the same details and take home messages as someone who can look at the image
