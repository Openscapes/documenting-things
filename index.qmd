# SPEAKER NOTES
# - Hi! I'm going to talk about how documenting things can help teams tackle hard challeges and change culture across organizations, with examples from NASA and NOAA communities supporting climate change research and action. 
#- My name is Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science communities over past the 10 years. Documenting things has been a big part of shifting my career - Director of Openscapes.

THINGS 
:::

**all the things**

-   code & analyses
-   teaching resources
-   onboarding & community
-   fieldwork/lab protocols
-   blogs
-   events

FUTURE US
:::

**mindset & habit**

-   ourselves, teams, communities

-   in the next hour, week, decades

-   intentional, inclusive
:::
:::

::: notes
when I say things when I say future us, I'm thinking of a mindset beyond you and your computer. So thinking about how what you document now can save hundreds of emails later asking where things are or how to do things.
:::

## Documenting things doesn't have to be painful {.light-blue-bg}

<br>

In fact, it's supposed to be helpful.

<br>

It does take time however. The time you invest will save time soon for you and others. Slowing down to speed up. 

<br>

**Purpose today:** to help you document things effectively & be inspired by teams working together to be more efficient, productive, and less lonely. 

-   6-min lightening talk (inspired by [Jenny Bryan's Naming Files](https://github.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files#how-to-name-files) üíô)
-   9-min stories from NASA & Openscapes communities

::: notes
- my opinionated take on documenting things‚Äù

-   I'm also here to say documenting things doesn't have to be painful to write and boring to read.
-   I have 3 pieces of advice:
-   the plan for today
:::

## Have a place {.yellow-bg}

It doesn't matter where at first. Just write it down. 

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
<br>

**Google Doc**

<br>

<br>

**Notion**
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
<br>

**Wiki**

<br>

<br>

**Forum/Issues/Discussion**
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
<br>

**Quarto/Jupyter book**

<br>

<br>

**Slide deck**
:::
:::

::: notes
This can be whatever software you have transition: what's important about having a place is that it helps you write as you go -
:::

## Write as you go {.yellow-bg}

Develop the habit of writing things down in this place; break down otherwise looming tasks.



<br> TODO: GIF of this and embed

Arrow keys + shift + option (Mac)

Paste from your email/slack and put it here instead



::: notes
Write directly. Google Doc comments/issues have tendency to prolong/make ardous; write that thought in the doc.

you might find yourself writing it in an issue. depending, write it down in the doc itself. Like editing directly rather than adding a comment in a Google doc

:::

## Write in a modular way {.yellow-bg}

Writing in small bits is less daunting to write & maintain collaboratively.

:::

No true order; you'll move things around.

:::

Modular bits can be networked; not limited to linear flow. 
Don't repeat yourself ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)): know where things are and link instead. Like functions in code!
:::

:::

::: notes
Instead of writing things twice, know where the information is so you can link to it (Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

These are two examples from R for Excel Users, on the left

-   If you write code, you can think of this like calling functions from from other scripts or packages. Think like that.
-   Think of it like we have functions we call from another script. It lives one place
:::

## Make space {.yellow-bg}
Takes time - 20-min email pasting add up! Make it visible. 

Tell people you're documenting things. 

Visibility

Coworking

## Have an audience {.yellow-bg}

You're writing this for someone. Often, many audiences. Make it engaging - doesn't have to be dry or distant.

## Write in an inclusive tone {.yellow-bg}

We're in this together: Your readers are intelligent people, who are here to learn from you.

Consider your goals and style that welcome readers; e.g. avoid words that trivialize like 'simply'.

<br>



::: notes


Write as if these different audiences are all in the room with you. directed toward different audiences


:::

## Narrate code in small chunks {.yellow-bg}

Write short narrations for your code as you'd say it out loud.
Match this with your purpose; it's especially important for teaching.

Quarto now has a cool [code annotation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/code-annotation.html) feature to help!

::: notes
When we write tutorials with code, we write them as if we're teaching them outloud. What you would say is included. And we design the code in chunks for learners.
:::

## Share it {.yellow-bg}
Share online so people can find it - readers, contributors, users. 

Consider permissions & leverage different technologies to leave breadcrumbs.

<br>

:::

::: notes
Breadcrumbs. Internal link for NOAA Fisheries. That's ok. We can still all learn a lot by having as much public.

'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'
:::


## Design for readability, accessibility, & navigation {.yellow-bg}

::: notes
-   aesthetics matter, and don't have to be super time-consuming
-   accessibility matters - can mean screenreaders, low bandwidth, paywalls/permissions, and much more
-   navigation mtters - helping Future Us find what we need
:::

## Use section headers {.yellow-bg}

Section headers are important for accessibility tools (e.g. screen readers) to describe sections and document flow 

You can anchor directly to them to share an anchored URL.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

:::
[Naming things](https://github.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files#how-to-name-files) üíô is key here - Jenny Bryan says "embrace the slug"

:::


::: notes
Helps with accessibility since screen readers treat headers a specific way.
 
These are examples from Google Doc where you can insert a bookmark and Quarto where you can anchor in Markdown.

Maybe: Be Consistent - Not "example" and then 2nd example has a diff name. Indenting.
:::


## Use text formatting {.yellow-bg}

Formatting helps your readers follow along. 

::: borderbox
![](images/format-fonts-links.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a blog post where the hyperlinked text says Fire and Tree Mortality Database and the words tidymodels and geomtextpath are formatted for code " width="80%"}
:::


<br>

Distinguish `code` with fonts; (in Markdown \`code\` )

Hyperlink to descriptive text like [Fire and Tree Mortality Database](https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2020-0001), not that this thing you recommended is [here](https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2020-0001).

<br>

::: ref-text
Horst, [Exploring tree outcomes following fires](https://allisonhorst.github.io/posts/2022-03-10-tree-mortality-fires/).
:::

## Alternative text ("alt text") 

::: notes
note alt text should not just repeat the caption (if you have one) it should be descriptive - paint the picture of whatever you‚Äôre talking about so someone with a screen reader can listen to the alt text and get the same details and take home messages as someone who can look at the image

## Documenting things ... 

### Is important 

- Helps people feel less lost and like they belong
- Saves time - fewer emails asking where things are
- Make invisible work visible 

### Takes time

- Part of the job. Paid time.
- Learning and inspiration is cyclical - Jenny Bryan Naming things
- Reuse, don't reinvent. 


## Documenting things: Best advice to get started
