# SPEAKER NOTES
# - Hi! I'm going to talk about how documenting things can help teams tackle hard challeges and change culture across organizations, with examples from NASA and NOAA communities supporting climate change research and action. 
#- My name is Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science communities over past the 10 years. Documenting things has been a big part of shifting my career - Director of Openscapes.

THINGS 
:::

**all the things**

-   code
-   teaching resources
-   onboarding & community
-   fieldwork/lab protocols
-   blogs
-   events

FUTURE US
:::

**mindset & habit**

-   ourselves, teams, communities

-   in the next hour, week, decades

-   intentional, inclusive
:::
:::

::: notes
when I say things when I say future us, I'm thinking of a mindset beyond you and your computer. So thinking about how what you document now can save hundreds of emails later asking where things are or how to do things.

-   10-min stories


::: notes
-   I'm also here to say documenting things doesn't have to be painful to write and boring to read.
-   I have 3 pieces of advice:
-   the plan for today
:::

## [Have a place]{.yellow-bg}

It doesn't matter where at first. Just write it down. 

<br>

:::

::: notes
This can be whatever software you have transition: what's important about having a place is that it helps you write as you go -
:::

## Write as you go

Develop the habit of writing things down in this place; break down otherwise looming tasks.

<br>

**Make it useful to you & future us**

Documenting can mean listing slides for visibility & reuse!

<br> TODO: GIF of this and embed

Arrow keys + shift + option (Mac)

Paste from your email/slack and put it here instead

:::
:::


::: notes
Write directly. Google Doc comments/issues have tendency to prolong/make ardous; write that thought in the doc.

you might find yourself writing it in an issue. depending, write it down in the doc itself. Like editing directly rather than adding a comment in a Google doc

:::

## Write in a modular way (short bits)

Design in a way that is easier for you to write & maintain collaboratively.

No true order; you'll move things around.

:::

Modular bits can be networked; not limited to linear flow. 
Don't repeat yourself (DRY): know where things are and link instead.

Lowndes & Horst, [R for Excel Users](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel)
:::

::: notes
Instead of writing things twice, know where the information is so you can link to it (Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

These are two examples from R for Excel Users, on the left

-   If you write code, you can think of this like calling functions from from other scripts or packages. Think like that.
-   Think of it like we have functions we call from another script. It lives one place
:::

## [Have an audience]{.yellow-bg}

You're writing this for someone. Make it engaging - doesn't have to be dry or distant.

## Write in an inclusive tone

Your readers are intelligent people, who are here to learn from you.

We're in this together: consider your goals and style that welcome readers.

Thoughtful resources

-   Purpose, Outcomes, Process ([POP](https://suzannehawkes.com/2010/04/09/pop-everything/))
-   Carpentries Curriculum Developers Handbook ([CDH](https://cdh.carpentries.org/))
-   TODO: ICESAT-2 Hackweek Charley Haley
-   Mentoring Groups book

<br>

::: notes
Write what you'd actually say / keep things relevant to that audience

When we write tutorials, we write them as if we're teaching them outloud. What you would say is included. And we design the code in chunks for learners.
:::

## Share it 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'

Leverage different technologies to share online; consider contributors and leave breadcrumbs.

:::

## [Format for readability, accessibility, & navigation]{.yellow-bg}

::: notes
-   aesthetics matter, and don't have to be super time-consuming
-   accessibility matters - can mean screenreaders, low bandwidth, paywalls/permissions, and much more
-   navigation mtters - helping Future Us find what we need
:::

## Use section headers

You can anchor to headers: there will be links directly to them. TODO REWORD

:::

Name headers with this in mind - Jenny Bryan says "embrace the slug"

::: notes
These are examples from Google Doc where you can insert a bookmark and Quarto where you can anchor in Markdown.

Maybe: Be Consistent - Not "example" and then 2nd example has a diff name. Indenting.

Transition: OK so that is the end of the lightning talk, and hopefully now you're interested in hearing some stories of what this looks like and what's possible from it

We're motivated by finding solutions to the cascading impacts of climate change, and helping people see themselves as part of this growing movement --- "climate" does not need to be in your job title for you to contribute

## A framework to facilitate & scale inclusive open practices

![](images/openscapes-flywheel-simple.png){fig-alt="A diagram of the Openscapes flywheel. The Openscapes logo sits in the center of a cyclical process. The text around the logo reads as follows: 'Welcome bright spots (be they mentors or researchers) -- people who want to work better and collaborate' > 'Create space and place to connect and collaborate; remove barriers to participation (paid time, part of jobs)' > 'Invest in learning and trust; Everyone has something to learn, ask, teach; don't need to be an expert in everything. Cultivate psychological safety, growth mindset. Slowing down to speed up.' > 'Work Openly; Put what you learn into practice quickly, role-modeing sharing imperfect work and identifying common challenges and opportunities. Openness is a spectrum; first Future You and then Future Us' > Leverage common workflows, skills, tools; This is where we speed up: Iterate, reuse, remix with each other and teh broader community' > 'Inspire broader scientific communities through visible examples and leaders -- Open science shift' > repeat. These six steps are summarized by three overarching goals, which are also written around the logo: 'Engage a future us mindset', 'Empower learning culture', and 'Amplify open leaders'." fig-align="center" width="90%"}

-   Focused on this in Year 3; the other two were first priority. Iterative. this is the right time, and our other documentation made it easier to repeat (breadcrumbs) and then write this as we have time.

-   Get comfortable with imperfect
-   It takes time. part of your job. Paid time. Aligns with your job
-   It can help people feel less lost and like they belong.
-   Role model reuse of documentation (like we reuse code/packages)
