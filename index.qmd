# SPEAKER NOTES
# - Hi! I'm going to talk about how documenting things can help teams tackle hard challeges and change culture across organizations, with examples from NASA and NOAA communities supporting climate change research and action. 
#- My name is Julie Lowndes. I'm a marine ecologist and I grew up professionally in the R and Open science communities over past the 10 years. Documenting things has been a big part of shifting my career - Director of Openscapes.

THINGS 
:::

**all the things**

-   code & analyses
-   teaching resources
-   onboarding & community
-   fieldwork/lab protocols
-   blogs
-   events

FUTURE US
:::

**mindset & habit**

-   ourselves, teams, communities

-   in the next hour, week, decades

-   intentional, inclusive
:::
:::

::: notes
when I say things when I say future us, I'm thinking of a mindset beyond you and your computer. So thinking about how what you document now can save hundreds of emails later asking where things are or how to do things.
:::

## Documenting things doesn't have to be painful {.light-blue-bg}

In fact, it's designed to be helpful

It does take time however; purpose today is to help you do effectively & see what it can do for organizational change: making teams more efficient, productive, and less lonely.
<br>


<br>

Plan today:

-   5-min lightening talk (inspired by [Jenny Bryan's Naming Files](https://github.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files#how-to-name-files)) üíô
-   10-min stories

## Documenting things {.shout .yellow-bg}

::: doc-things-text
Have a place

Have an audience

Design for readability, accessibility, and navigation

::: notes
- my opinionated take on documenting things‚Äù

-   I'm also here to say documenting things doesn't have to be painful to write and boring to read.
-   I have 3 pieces of advice:
-   the plan for today
:::

## Have a place {.yellow-bg}

It doesn't matter where at first. Just write it down. 

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
<br>

**Google Doc**

<br>

**Notion**

**Slide deck**
:::
:::

::: notes
This can be whatever software you have transition: what's important about having a place is that it helps you write as you go -
:::

## Share it with collaborators {.yellow-bg}

Define collaborators as Future Us - readers, contriburs, users

Leverage different technologies to share online; consider contributors and leave breadcrumbs.

'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'

Breadcrumbs. Internal link for NOAA Fisheries. That's ok. We can still all learn a lot by having as much public.

-   can help you refine place quarto, rmarkdown, google docs
:::


## Write as you go {.yellow-bg}

Develop the habit of writing things down in this place; break down otherwise looming tasks.



<br> TODO: GIF of this and embed

Arrow keys + shift + option (Mac)

Paste from your email/slack and put it here instead



::: notes
Write directly. Google Doc comments/issues have tendency to prolong/make ardous; write that thought in the doc.

you might find yourself writing it in an issue. depending, write it down in the doc itself. Like editing directly rather than adding a comment in a Google doc

keyboard shortcuts -
:::

## Write in a modular way {.yellow-bg}

Writing in small bits is less daunting to write & maintain collaboratively.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: borderbox
[![](images/modular-r-for-excel.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of an e-book left navigation bar for R, RStudio, and RMarkdown, with subsections Summary, RStudio Orientation, Intro to RMarkdown, R code in the Console, R functions, Help pages, Commenting" width="48%"}](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/rstudio.html)

No true order; you'll move things around.

:::

Modular bits can be networked; not limited to linear flow. 
Don't repeat yourself ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)): know where things are and link instead. Like functions in code!
:::
:::

Lowndes & Horst, [R for Excel Users](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel)
:::

::: notes
Instead of writing things twice, know where the information is so you can link to it (Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

These are two examples from R for Excel Users, on the left

-   If you write code, you can think of this like calling functions from from other scripts or packages. Think like that.
-   Think of it like we have functions we call from another script. It lives one place
:::

## Have an audience {.yellow-bg}

You're writing this for someone. Often, many audiences. Make it engaging - doesn't have to be dry or distant.

## Write in an inclusive tone {.yellow-bg}

Your readers are intelligent people, who are here to learn from you.

We're in this together: consider your goals and style that welcome readers.

Write as if these different audiences are all in the room with you. directed toward different audiences

TODO e.g. ‚ÄúAvoid words that trivialize like ‚Äòsimply‚Äô‚Äù

<br>



::: notes
Write what you'd actually say / keep things relevant to that audience

When we write tutorials, we write them as if we're teaching them outloud. What you would say is included. And we design the code in chunks for learners.
:::

## Narrate code in small chunks {.yellow-bg}

Write short narrations for your code as you'd say it out loud.
Match this with your purpose; it's especially important for teaching.

TODO: Narrate in small chunks -- Quarto now has a cool annotation feature for this too!

## Design for readability, accessibility, & navigation {.yellow-bg}

::: notes
-   aesthetics matter, and don't have to be super time-consuming
-   accessibility matters - can mean screenreaders, low bandwidth, paywalls/permissions, and much more
-   navigation mtters - helping Future Us find what we need
:::

## Use section headers {.yellow-bg}

Section headers are important for accessibility tools (e.g. screen readers) to describe sections and document flow 

You can anchor directly to them to share an anchored URL.

[Naming things](https://github.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files#how-to-name-files) üíô is key here - Jenny Bryan says "embrace the slug"

:::


::: notes
Helps with accessibility since screen readers treat headers a specific way.
 
These are examples from Google Doc where you can insert a bookmark and Quarto where you can anchor in Markdown.

Maybe: Be Consistent - Not "example" and then 2nd example has a diff name. Indenting.
:::


## Use text formatting {.yellow-bg}

Formatting helps your readers follow along. 

::: borderbox
![](images/format-fonts-links.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a blog post where the hyperlinked text says Fire and Tree Mortality Database and the words tidymodels and geomtextpath are formatted for code " width="80%"}
:::


<br>

Distinguish `code` with fonts; (in Markdown \`code\` )

Hyperlink to descriptive text like [Fire and Tree Mortality Database](https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2020-0001), not that this thing you recommended is [here](https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2020-0001).

::: ref-text
Horst, [Exploring tree outcomes following fires](https://allisonhorst.github.io/posts/2022-03-10-tree-mortality-fires/).
:::

## Alternative text ("alt text") 

::: notes
note alt text should not just repeat the caption (if you have one) it should be descriptive - paint the picture of whatever you‚Äôre talking about so someone with a screen reader can listen to the alt text and get the same details and take home messages as someone who can look at the image

![](images/openscapes-flywheel-simple.png){fig-alt="A diagram of the Openscapes flywheel. The Openscapes logo sits in the center of a cyclical process. The text around the logo reads as follows: 'Welcome bright spots (be they mentors or researchers) -- people who want to work better and collaborate' > 'Create space and place to connect and collaborate; remove barriers to participation (paid time, part of jobs)' > 'Invest in learning and trust; Everyone has something to learn, ask, teach; don't need to be an expert in everything. Cultivate psychological safety, growth mindset. Slowing down to speed up.' > 'Work Openly; Put what you learn into practice quickly, role-modeing sharing imperfect work and identifying common challenges and opportunities. Openness is a spectrum; first Future You and then Future Us' > Leverage common workflows, skills, tools; This is where we speed up: Iterate, reuse, remix with each other and teh broader community' > 'Inspire broader scientific communities through visible examples and leaders -- Open science shift' > repeat.

## Documenting things ... 

### Is important 

- Helps people feel less lost and like they belong
- Saves time - fewer emails asking where things are
- Make invisible work visible 

### Takes time

- Part of the job. Paid time.
- Learning and inspiration is cyclical - Jenny Bryan Naming things
- Reuse, don't reinvent. 


## Documenting things: Best advice to get started
